# React App Deployment to Elastic Beanstalk with Docker

This repository contains a simple React app that can be easily deployed to Elastic Beanstalk (EBS). The deployment workflow is automated using GitHub Actions. The workflow logs in to DockerHub, builds Docker images using the Dockerfile.dev, runs npm tests, and generates a deployment package that is then moved to Elastic Beanstalk for deployment.
